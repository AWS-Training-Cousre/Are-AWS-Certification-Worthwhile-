# Are AWS Certification Worthwhile?

Some people frequently ask me if obtaining a certification such as the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate is sufficient to land them a job.
The problem is that it requires much more than certification: you also need relevant experience for the position you're seeking and to be highly " employable. " (more on that shortly).

I believe it is also fair to argue that AWS credentials are now more of a need than a distinction. This is generally the situation unless you have several [AWS certificates]. Everyone appears to have their [Solutions Architect Associate certification].

Therefore, it won't set you out when applying for an AWS Solution Architect position. Indeed, from an employer's standpoint, it will be assumed that you have a handful of AWS certifications – and if you don't, you won't be recognized.

I recommend completing at least all of the AWS associate certifications, as well as at least one professional level or specialty. Attempt to align the credentials with your own experience and select certificates that are related to the career responsibilities you desire. The cloud practitioner is also an excellent place to start and an extra certification to put on your resume, so it's worth doing that as well.

It's helpful to put yourself in the employer's position and consider what they're looking for when hiring. From there, you may figure out what you need to do to obtain an advantage over others in your search for a job working in the cloud. So, what does a potential employer look for?

•	Someone has the required qualifications for the job.
•	Someone with prior expertise who can get up and running fast.
•	Someone good at communicating Someone who works effectively in a team/group
•	Someone who is motivated to a great extent and can work with little supervision
•	Someone who is trustworthy and has a good outlook

Relevant skills – Try to apply for positions where your talents are directly related to the job description. Work on your CV for each position you apply for, emphasizing the qualities the company seeks. For example, the skills and experience requirements for an [AWS Cloud Architect] position will differ from those for an AWS Engineer post.

Unfortunately, businesses (particularly recruiters) sometimes publish job descriptions with extensive skill requirements that would practically require an entire team to accomplish. Try to figure out the main emphasis of the listed position and make sure your talents are a good fit.

Furthermore, the job description for AWS positions will rarely call for AWS expertise. Additional skill sets, such as operating system administration (Linux and Windows), database capabilities, programming languages, and automation and configuration management tools, to mention a few, will always be necessary. Check out what talents are in high demand now and be sure to include them in your training strategy.
